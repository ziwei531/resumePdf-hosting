# How to use

-   If you wish to use this and host your resume via github pages, fork this repo, then upload your file at the pdf folder, replacing the existing resume.pdf. Make sure your file is named resume.pdf as that's the name I've used in the script.js. Also, change the title that is within the html, it is surrounded by `<title></title>`. It is currently using my personal name so do change it if you plan to use this project.

-   If you know coding, you can alter this repo as you see fit once you've forked this.
